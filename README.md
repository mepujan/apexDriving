# Apex Driving Web Application

***
### Purpose of the Application
> The purpose of this project is to provide a cloud-based solution for a better experience for driving school students to book driving lessons with their instructors. No longer did both students and instructors need to jot down their schedule on their phone manually. Our solution greatly reduces the chance that either side forgot about marking down their schedule and didnâ€™t show up during the appointed lessons. Moreover, this solution provides a clear way for both students and instructors to check their schedule. This prevents confusion of scheduling and overall provides a better user experience for both sides.
